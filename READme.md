## Programme Running Process ##
This entire programme was wrote in react app environment, and should be able to run as in following command.
I wrote the code in Mac envrinoment, so the comand I posted following should work under Mac terminal.

1. cd into the direct file. The file name is helloworld.
2. $npm start
3. The url should be automatically appear in safari, otherwise, search for localhost:3000 or localhost:8080

Then you should be able to manipulate the code locally, because it is used react app environment, suppose you have npm tool and webpack installed in your computer and working properly.
